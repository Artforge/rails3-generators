## Rails 3 Generators

RSpec, DataMapper and HAML templates from the Ruby community straight to your plate!

### Installation

    # From the root of your Rails application
    git clone git://github.com/jcf/rails3-generators.git lib/generators

### Further Reading

These templates were created by a couple of people, I simply fixed a couple of bugs and did some spring-cleaning.

Check out [Paul Barry's post][pb] for more information on these generators.
